title: JavaScript
---

JavaScript is a popular programming language that is primarily use to build Web Applications.
This is useful as it allows programs to be written once and run on multiple platforms, wherever there is a browser, you can run JavaScript.

To learn more than you will ever need to know about JavaScript I can highly recommend [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) by Mozilla.
Who better to learn about JavaScript from than an organisation who have created their own browser (Firefox).
